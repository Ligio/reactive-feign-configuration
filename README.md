# reactive-feign-configuration

A sample project to show the different behavior between Reactive Feign 3.2.3 and 3.2.5

Run the test to check how the two releases are managing retries and errors.

In order to change reactive feign version, uncomment the proper dependency in build.gradle file.

There are breaking changes that should have been documented 
and probably a major version should have been created instead of a minor one.
